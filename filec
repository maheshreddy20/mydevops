Here's an example of how 
Git branches ar
e useful. Let's say 
 to work on a new feat
ure for a website. You

 create a new branch and start working. You haven't finished your new feature, but you get a request to make a rush change that needs to go live on the site today. You switch back to the master branch, make the change, and push it live. Then you can switch back to your new feature branch and finish your work. When you're done, you merge the new feature branch into the 
master branch, and both the new feature and rush change are kept!
